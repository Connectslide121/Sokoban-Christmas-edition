# Sokoban
Lexicon - .NET course - Week 12 assignment

A Sokoban game made with JavaScript. [Play here](https://connectslide121.github.io/Sokoban/)

The Map Converter was created to convert the maps I found [here](https://github.com/begoon/sokoban-maps/blob/master/maps/sokoban-maps-60-plain.txt#L9) into the format I needed for my game.
